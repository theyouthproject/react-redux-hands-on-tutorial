# React-Redux Tutorial
This repository will explain you what is Redux, why we use redux and how to use Redux in your projects.

This is a hands-on tutorial so we recommend that you follow every single step as it is and also create your own project folder in parallel. Just reading through the documentation without implementing may lead to more confusion and questions.

**Estimated Completion Time:** 2 hours (only start if you have this time available)

## What is Redux?
Redux in simple words is a state management library. In React we learnt that everything that is displayed to the user is controlled by the `state` variable of every component. **Redux** just allows us to manage that `state` variable better to create better, performant and scalable web applications.

Next, rather than jumping directly into the redux architecture, let's see why actually we need this.

## Why do I need Redux?
In simple words, you don't need redux but **you definitely need something like redux if not redux** in your application. As the application scales it becomes harder and harder to manage so many components and the state which is in them. Let's use a simple E-Commerce example to explain why.
